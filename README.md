# NPPGit
Git with Notepad++

Plugin to use Git with Notepad++


The original plugin was posted here:
https://forum.lowyat.net/topic/1358320/all

I just needed to add Blame command, so I put the source code here.

## Instalation

First you need to install TortoiseGit, because this plugin simply uses the command line features of TortoiseGit.
https://tortoisegit.org/

After that, take the DLL NPPGit.dll on the Release folder of this repository and copy to the Notepad\+\+ plugins folder.
By default located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\plugins

Next time you open Notepad\+\+ you can access through menu Plugins->Git
